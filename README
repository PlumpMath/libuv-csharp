libuv-sharp
==========

What
----

C# bindings to [libuv][0]... that's about it. Ultimate goal is to provide really good cross-platform evented sockets for [manos][1].

Status
-----

It runs on my machine :)
Right now the server is one file and simply writes what it recieves over tcp to stdout.
Currently the makefile is mac only, but it won't be hard to port to linux. Not sure about windows yet.

Build and Run
-------------

	make
	mono build/webserver.exe

Somewhere else:

	telnet localhost 8080


TODO
----

* Build on all platforms
* Implement all of the api
* Get rid of memory leaks
